                </div>
                <div class="about-me-info">
                    <p>As of today, I am in the final parts of obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in computer science, from Simon Fraser University.</p>
                    <p>I am a self-motivated software developer who enjoys learning, is eager to test new technologies, and has proven his ability to write maintainable, 
                        testable, and performant software. My professional experiences have provided me with skills in efficient communication, team-oriented ethics, and 
                        accurate workload evaluation. I have developed adaptability in problem-solving and regularly approach tasks with a constructive and confident 
                        attitude. Above all, I bring my willingness to learn to every opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have understood the fundamental methods of software development, which are highlighted in my professional and personal experiences.</p>
                    <p>My career journey has been shaped by the following opportunities:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-cell-td">
                    <label for="td">TD Bank</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" name="three" id="td" hidden/>
                    <div class="hide-td">
                        <div class="inner-td">
                            <p>
                                I knew I had discovered a place where growth and development were not only encouraged, but actually nurtured, the moment I stepped 
                                into TD Bank as a Customer Experience Associate. The upbeat spirit that pervaded the bank's hallways was more than just a passing feeling; 
                                it was a mindset that influenced every encounter and decision. Little did I realize that this first role would pave the way for a spectacular 
                                career that would eventually lead me to where I am today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a Customer Experience Associate, I relished the ability to interact with clients while resolving their financial requirements 
                                and worries. Each connection was an opportunity to make a positive difference, and I found enormous satisfaction in delivering answers 
                                and developing long-term relationships. The training programs, mentorship initiatives, and real companionship among colleagues demonstrated 
                                the bank's dedication to encouraging workers to attain their greatest potential.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nonetheless, as much as I adored my work, there was an inescapable tug towards a new path, one that resonated powerfully with my ambitions. 
                                Years passed, and I devoted myself not only to my profession but also to my studies, all the while imagining a future in which I might contribute 
                                to a world that was both inclusive and sustainable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, the day came when I graduated from university, armed with a plethora of information and strong determination.  
                                It was time for me to continue on my journey.

                                My position as a web developer at Archive Digital entailed far more than lines of code - it was about creating seamless online experiences. 
                                With a strong desire to improve user interactions, I set out on a mission to change the way we approached web functionality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One particular project stands out in my mind. I recall the early days of the project, when ideas flowed like waterfalls.  
                                My workplace was covered with sketches and wireframes, each stroke of the digital pen bringing a vision to life. As the concepts progressed, 
                                I dabbled with coding, fitting together the delicate puzzle of utility and beauty. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The result of lines of code fused into a symphony of digital creativity was stunning. I had successfully created a set of modular 
                                features that effortlessly merged across various web pages. Buttons whispered invitations to explore, menus gently danced, and content 
                                disclosed itself organically, all thanks to the architecture I had built.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The impact of the redesigned site functionalities was evident when they went live. User feedback poured in, expressing delight and contentment. 
                                The navigation was intuitive, the interactions were fluid, and the overall experience was excellent. I felt a deep feeling of accomplishment, 
                                knowing that my work had directly benefited the digital journeys of many individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My time at Archive Digital showed me that web development is more than just writing code; it's a tool for creating experiences. 
                                It's about visualizing a user's interaction before writing a single line of code, and then turning that vision into reality. The story 
                                of those modular features became a tribute to my devotion, ingenuity, and determination as a web developer - a story I am proud to tell as 
                                I continue to explore new frontiers in the ever-changing digital realm.

                                My time with Damon Motorcycles started out with a wave of adrenaline and nervous expectation. 
                                When I first arrived in the fast-paced startup environment, I quickly realized that multitasking 
                                was more than just a buzzword. Every day brought new tasks, and I had to be alert to keep up with 
                                the changing demands of the projects I was working on.

                            <p>
                                Working in cross-functional teams became second nature to me as we worked together to bring creative 
                                concepts to life. The rush of watching our ideas come to life, from the drawing board to the workshop floor, 
                                was unlike anything I'd ever felt before. I knew then that I had found my calling in the realm of programming and 
                                engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my time at Damon, one item that struck out was the significance of completing extensive functionality tests. 
                                Our motorcycles had to be not just stylish, but also dependable and safe.  Extensive time was spent conducting simulations, 
                                evaluating data, and pushing prototypes to their limits.  Failure was inevitable, but each setback taught us important lessons 
                                and spurred us ahead.

                                As my duties increased, I found myself in a unique position within the team.  I was assigned the duty of completing 
                                extensive research on crucial components that will define the general path of our motorcycles. My research focused on ensuring 
                                that our ideas could be scaled for different markets and consumer needs.

                                My efforts, however, went beyond coding and research. When project requirements were vague, I found the art of bridging gaps 
                                among teams. This required improving my communication skills, actively listening to others, and cultivating a collaborative and 
                                understanding environment. As a mediator between different departments, I learnt to address problems with empathy and diplomacy.

                                My experiences at Damon Motorcycles not only improved me as a developer, but also as a coworker. 
                                Being given decision-making duties allowed me to build trust with my coworkers. I found that leadership is 
                                more than just making decisions; it is also about inspiring and encouraging others to reach their full potential.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I felt a sense of satisfaction and thankfulness as the final chapter of my Damon journey unfolded. My relationships with my coworkers 
                                extended beyond professional camaraderie; they were true pals. Our combined efforts have contributed to the development of 
                                extraordinary motorcycles that will be making an excellent impact around the world.
                            </p>

                                It was difficult to leave Damon Motorcycles, but I knew that the experiences and lessons I had received there would be with me forever. I now move 
                                on to new opportunities, carrying the zeal and drive that the startup instilled in me. Damon Motorcycles' journey will long be 
                                woven into the fabric of my personal and professional development, whether it was addressing tough software issues or developing great teams.
